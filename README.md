# StudioDepth
### A Vanilla JS Project Born from a Random Sunday Scroll

---

## **🎯 Overview & Purpose**

This project is a one-page website implementation inspired by a design from my friend, Wisdom. It was an impromptu coding session aimed at flexing my **Vanilla JavaScript** skills and practicing clean, simple, and premium design principles.

While the design is simple, the implementation focuses on structure, component-based thinking (like in React), and attention to detail, proving that you don't always need a complex framework to create a polished product.

## **✨ Features**

* **Responsive, Single-Page Design:** A clean, professional layout that looks great on high-definition screens.
* **Vanilla JS Implementation:** No frameworks (like React, Vue, or Angular) were used—just pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* **Component-Based Structure:** Written with a mindset of modularity to avoid **"CSS file hell,"** making the code easy to navigate and maintain.

## **💻 Getting Started**

Since this is a simple static site, getting it running is easy!

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/thelordnexy/StudioDepth.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd StudioDepth
    ```
3.  **Open the file:**
4.  Launch the `resource_server.js` file manually or using `npm start` command, this starts the StudioDepth files server.
    Simply visit the specified domain name and port number `http://localhost:3306/` in your favorite web browser.

## **👨‍💻 The Story Behind the Code**

> "Both are nice but the second is more professional."

It was on a Sunday, I was randomly viewing WhatsApp statuses when I stumbled upon designs put up by my good friend **Wisdom**. As usual, I gave him my honest opinion, loving the clean, simple, and yet **premium designs**.

On second thought, I decided to actually write the code for the design. Yeah, it was just a one-page website, but since I hadn't flexed my JavaScript muscle in a long while (at least that is how I always feel), I decided it was worth the effort.

### **The Process**

1.  **The Mockup:** Work began with studying the design and determining how I'd slice it up into different components. I fired up **Lunacy** (you heard that right, Figma boys 😉) and created a mockup version of the design with accurate measurements for a HD screen. With the precise mockup done, almost all the work had been completed.
2.  **The Tech Stack:** Next, I had to decide: should I use React? Nah, this was too little for React, but I didn't want to face a **CSS file hell**, so I decided to write it like I would in a framework, but this time only with **Vanilla JS**. (Yeah, you heard me, fellow noobs! For the chads, please allow me to massage my ego in peace.)

I cooked, and the contents of this repository is the meal.
